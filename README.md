# Task-Oriented Dialog System in Assamese (T.O.D.S.A.)

This repository contains the code for a Task-Oriented Dialog System (T.O.D.S.A.) implemented in the Assamese language. The system focuses on speech recognition and audio processing, allowing users to perform various operations through voice commands.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to enable users to interact with devices using voice commands in the native Assamese language. The key features and methodologies implemented include:

- Creation of a specialized dataset for Assamese speech
- Development of a CNN model for predicting Assamese text from speech data
- Integration of the speech recognition system into a desktop application
- Incorporation of both English and Assamese bilingual recognition processes
- Utilization of Python, Bash script, SQL, and string processing for system functionality

## Major Features

The T.O.D.S.A. project offers several key features:

- Recognition of both Assamese and English languages
- Prediction of text for Assamese language
- Execution of various system operations and applications through voice commands
- Simple conversational interface with users
- Manual updating of the stored database
- Downloading of contents from the internet using a browser

## Instruction for Use

To use the English task-oriented dialog system, create a database named "todsabase".
