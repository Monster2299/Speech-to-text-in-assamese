# Speech-to-text-in-Assamese
Speech to text in Assamese using CNN model
Word wise classified and mapped to text
<h3>“Task oriented dialog system in native language (Assamese)” and its results experiments development methodologies. The name task-oriented dialog system simply refers to the technology where people can perform operation simply by giving voice commands to the device.
And speech recognition system where audio sample is accepted by the application and converts this audio data to numerical form and predicts the spoken text by the user for Assamese language.
We implemented these methodologies-
•	I developed Assamese speech dataset 
•	I developed CNN model to predict Assamese text from a given speech
•	I used the trained model and developed desktop Application
•	I used English and Assamese bilingual recognition process in the task-oriented dialog system application.
